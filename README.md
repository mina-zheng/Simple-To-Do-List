This is a simple to do list that utilizes the Canvas API to automatically import upcoming assignments. 

To save passkeys, manually save it as a variable in the canvas.py file, or in a separate file (in here, I've used key.py.) Feel free to delete "import keys".

The first text box is for the imported Canvas assignments, and the second is for user inputted assignments. Any user inputs into the first box will be cleared if the Auto Import checkbox is toggled.
